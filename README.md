- 21-40 WPM: Look at you, speedster! You're the "Fast and Furious" of the typing world, if the movie was about typing really important emails to your grandma.
- 41-60 WPM: Wow! You're typing so fast, you might actually finish writing that novel before the heat death of the universe. No pressure.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Challenging Yourself (Without Resorting to Cheap Tricks)

Sure, you could spam "a a a a a" faster than a caffeinated woodpecker, but where's the fun in that? Here are some *totally serious* ways to improve your score:

1. **Type the entire works of Shakespeare:** Nothing says "I'm a typing god" like hammering out Hamlet in one sitting. To be or not to be... typing, that is.

2. **Transcribe your inner monologue:** Warning: May result in existential crisis or spontaneous poetry. Side effects include realizing you really need to buy milk.

3. **Rewrite the Constitution:** Who knows, you might accidentally improve it. "We the People, in order to form a more perfect typing speed..."

4. **Compose an opera:** In Italian. Don't speak Italian? Even better! Let your fingers do the talking. Mamma mia, that's a spicy WPM!

5. **Write a heartfelt apology to your keyboard:** It's been through a lot. "Dear QWERTY, I'm sorry for all the aggressive tapping..."

Remember, the real typing test is the friends we made along the way. And by friends, we mean the calluses on your fingertips.

Now go forth and type like the wind! May your WPM be high and your typos be few. And if anyone asks why you're laughing maniacally at your keyboard, just tell them you're "optimizing your productivity." They'll understand. Probably.
